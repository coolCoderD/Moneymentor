            Financial planning is a broad umbrella that covers a number of topics, including:
            </div>
            <ul className="px-10 pb-5 list-disc">
                <li className="pb-2 text-lg">Budgeting</li>
                <li className="pb-2 text-lg">Spending</li>
                <li className="pb-2 text-lg">Saving</li>
                <li className="pb-2 text-lg">Retirement Planning</li>
                <li className="pb-2 text-lg">Credit And Debt</li>
            </ul>
            <div className="w-5/6 text-lg pb-5">To lay the groundwork for a solid financial foundation, you need to understand how each of these topics works together and affect each other. Here's a quick crash course in the most important aspects of financial planning.</div>
            <div>
                <h1 className="font-semibold text-3xl">1.Budgeting</h1>
                <div className="w-5/6 pb-5 pt-5">
                <div className="pb-4 text-lg">At the basic level of personal finance, budgeting is one of the most important tools you can have. A budget is a plan for how you spend the money you earn.</div>
                <div className="pb-4 text-lg">Creating a detailed written budget allows you to see exactly where your money is going and make better decisions about how you spend. When you consciously think about budgeting decisions, you gain a lot more control of how you spend your money.</div>
                <div className="pb-4 text-lg">One of the biggest challenges with not having a detailed budget is being faced with so many financial decisions and trying to keep track of everything. This lack of understanding can lead to overspending and debt, not to mention it makes financial planning for the future more difficult.</div>
                
                </div>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h1 className="font-semibold text-3xl">2.Tracking Expenses</h1>
                <div className="w-5/6 pb-5 pt-5">
                <div className="pb-4 text-lg">Tracking your spending is a key part of budgeting. This tracking includes keeping close tabs on your non-essential expenses, such as clothing, dining out, travel, or entertainment.</div>
                <div className="pb-4 text-lg">If you're spending too much on non-essentials, you may not be leaving anything left over to save each month. And saving matters, especially when it comes to creating an emergency fund.</div>
                <div className="pb-4 text-lg">Your emergency fund is a go-to pool of cash you can rely on when an emergency or an unexpected expense comes your way. Having emergency savings on hand can keep you from going into debt. If you're not tracking your spending diligently, you may be letting money that you could save slip through the cracks.</div>
                
                </div>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h1 className="font-semibold text-3xl">3. Credit and Debt</h1>
                <div className="w-5/6 pb-5 pt-5">
                <div className="pb-4 text-lg">Financial leverage, or using credit and taking on debt by itself, isn’t necessarily a bad thing. However, there are two kinds of debt: good debt and bad debt.</div>
                <div className="pb-4 text-lg">When you borrow money to purchase a home, you may be taking on a lot of debt, but lower interest rates and the purchase of an asset that can increase in value is considered an acceptable form of debt. The same goes for student loans since you're financing a degree that could increase your earning potential, often at a low-interest rate.</div>
                <div className="pb-4 text-lg">On the other hand, going on a shopping spree at the mall using a credit card that has a 24% annual interest rate without paying it off in full right away is bad debt. You're buying things that don't grow in value, and you're paying steep interest to buy them if you carry a balance on your card.</div>
                
                </div>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h1 className="font-semibold text-3xl">4. Saving for Retirement</h1>
                <div className="w-5/6 pb-5 pt-5">
                <div className="pb-4 text-xl">With fewer companies offering full pension plans and the uncertainty of Social Security, it's become more important than ever to save and plan for your retirement. Unfortunately, many people feel that they don’t have enough money left over each month to save.</div>
                <div className="pb-4 text-xl">Retirement savings needs to become a priority instead of an afterthought. The Internal Revenue Service has made saving for retirement even more attractive with special tax-advantaged accounts such as employer 401(k) plans, individual retirement accounts, and special retirement accounts for the self-employed. These allow for tax deductions, credits, and even tax-free earnings on retirement savings.</div>
                <div className="pb-4 text-xl">Whether you are just out of college and have 40 years until retirement or you plan on retiring next year, it is never too late to plan and to maximize your retirement savings. Ideally, you should be aiming to save 10% to 15% of your income each year for retirement. But, if you can't do that, shoot for saving at least enough in your employer's retirement plan to qualify for the matching contribution if there is one. Then, work on increasing your contribution rate each year.</div>
