                        It's one thing to know that you need a budget, and another to make one and stick to it. Making a budget—and sticking to it—can help alleviate financial stress. The majority of people who maintain a budget report feeling more in control, more confident, and more secure. Convinced, but not sure how to proceed? This multistep approach to budgeting can help you get started.

                            <div className="pb-4 text-xl">Before you budget, you need to decide what you want your plan to do for you. Consider these activities to help you brainstorm:</div>
                            <div className="pb-4 text-xl">1. Write down three or four things you want to accomplish in the next five to 10 years. This may include things like home ownership, starting a family, or running your own business. </div>
                            <div className="pb-4 text-xl">2. Write down two things you want to accomplish in the next year in regard to your finances. Perhaps you want to pay off debt, build an emergency fund, or start a new career.</div>
                            <div className="pb-4 text-xl">3. Write down one thing you want to accomplish in the next month. This may be saving a certain amount of money or not using your credit cards for at least 30 days.</div>

                            <div className="pb-4 text-xl">Once you have decided on your goals, you can set up your budget. To start, gather all of the necessary paperwork you may need, such as bank statements or investment accounts. You'll want to calculate your expected monthly income, as well as your typical monthly expenses, and break it all down into categories. If your income is higher than your expenses, you are off to a good start.</div>

                                It can be time-consuming to track your expenses, record your transactions each day, and subtract them from the correct budget category. Even more challenging: making sure your expenses do not exceed your income. You can use computer software, make an old-fashioned, pen-and-paper budget, or rely on the envelope system to make your budget work for you.

                            <div className="pb-4 text-xl">Tally up all of your monthly savings goals into a lump sum. You will need to find that amount of money in your budget. You should set this up so that it happens automatically, before you even have a chance to spend the money on something else. Some companies will direct deposit part of your check into a savings account or you can have your bank automatically draft that amount into a savings account every payday.</div>

                            <div className="pb-4 text-xl"> After one month, you will need to evaluate your budget. This is essential for getting it to work.

                                Ideally, you should plan to evaluate your budget monthly for at least the first six months. This will help you learn to identify your budget weaknesses. Then, you can make adjustments to areas where you may have estimated the wrong amount.

                                In the first month, you should not make major cuts, but each month after that, try cutting back to save more. After the first two months, you may be able to cut your spending back even more than you originally thought, and increase the amount you put toward your goals. Keep in mind that it is OK if you realize that you need to increase spending in a category; just be sure to subtract that amount from another category to keep your budget balanced.</div>
